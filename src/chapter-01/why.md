# Why this book?

Over the last couple of years I have become more and more interested in the teachings of the Buddha. My first encounter with Buddhism was during high school when I was first struck by the story about the prince leaving his home after encountering sickness, aging and death. My image of Buddhism was also romanticized by the 70s TV series [Kung Fu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_ "Kung Fu TV series"). It was years later after I found that mindfulness meditation helped me be a happier person, that I discovered the work of [Stephen Batchelor](https://www.stephenbatchelor.org/index.php/en/ "Website of Stephen and Martine Batchelor"), which was the main reason for me to write this book. I saw some big parallels between the teachings of Mr. 'Gotama' (the family name of the historical figure called the Buddha) as presented by Mr. Batchelor and my views and understanding of Agile software development. In my goal to leave the world behind a nicer place than I found it, I want to try looking at Agile software development from an ethical viewpoint rather than an effectivity increasing point of view. I firmly believe that the ethics and life aids as presented by Mr. Gotama can greatly benefit each and every person in this world and specifically every software developer.
