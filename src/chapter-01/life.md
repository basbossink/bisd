# Life of the Buddha

The life of the Buddha is sketched on the [Wikipedia page about Gotama][gotama] as cited earlier. The first thing to note that although popular folklore tells the myth of Gotama the prince born from the side of his mother. Gotama was not a prince but 'merely' a son of a local chosen chief. At around the age of thirty he left his wife and son to leave for his spiritual quest. He studied with some teachers and gained high levels of skill in meditation, with them but was still unsatisfied with both there teachings and continued his journey. Finally he sat down under the famous Boddhi tree where he woke up to his middle way. By then Gotama was 35, he spent the rest of his life (another 45 years) wondering the eastern parts of ancient India teaching.
