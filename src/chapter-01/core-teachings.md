## The Middle Way

Although the idea of the midle path is used by many these days in a very broad sense, Mr. Gotama used it to mean a very specific middle way between two dead ends. Namely the dead end of sensual pleasure and the dead end of self-mortification. This definition of the middle way can be found in the first discourse given by Mr. Gotama, Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta [Rolling Forth the Wheel of Dhamma][wheel]. Translating self-mortification to lay persons psychology one might interpret it as self hatred or self denial. In the third paragraph of the above mentioned Sutra, Gotama defines the middle way as: 
> It is simply this noble eightfold path, ...

Which will be discussed below. Suffice to say that in this book the term middle way will be taken to mean being kind to oneself.

## Dependent origination

[The wikipedia page on dependent origination][dependent] states:

> Pratītyasamutpāda (Sanskrit: प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद pratītyasamutpāda; Pali: पटिच्चसमुप्पाद paṭiccasamuppāda), commonly translated as dependent origination, or dependent arising, is a key principle in Buddhist teachings, which states that all dharmas ("phenomena") arise in dependence upon other dharmas: "if this exists, that exists; if this ceases to exist, that also ceases to exist".

This concept could also be translated to inter-dependence or inter-being, the idea that nothing exists in itself but everything arises caused by something else. 

## The four noble truths

The four noble truths, or ennobling truths are considered to be the core of
the teachings of Mr. Gotama. Again quoting [wikipedia][four]:

> In Buddhism, the Four Noble Truths (Sanskrit: catvāri āryasatyāni; Pali: cattāri ariyasaccāni; "The four Arya satyas") are "the truths of the Noble Ones", the truths or realities for the "spiritually worthy ones". The truths are:
> 
>   - dukkha (suffering, incapable of satisfying, painful) is an innate characteristic of existence in the realm of samsara;
>   - samudaya (origin, arising) of this dukkha, which arises or "comes together" with taṇhā ("craving, desire or attachment");
>   - nirodha (cessation, ending) of this dukkha can be attained by the renouncement or letting go of this taṇhā;
>   - magga (path, Noble Eightfold Path) is the path leading to renouncement of tanha and cessation of dukkha.
> 
>  They are traditionally identified as the first teaching given by the Buddha, and considered one of the most important teachings in Buddhism. 

### Dukkha

Another way of translating dukkha is unsatisfactoryness. One could think of
dukkha as describing the pain of things being subjected to decay, things are
dukkha because they don't last.

### Origin of Dukkha

The origin of dukkha is our unwillingness to accept that all things will end.
Our hanging on to pleasent things and our non-acceptance of unpleasent things.

### Letting go of grasping

Our comming to terms with the fact that all things come to an end. 

### The noble eightfold path

In both of the on [suttacentral](https://suttacentral.net/) available english translations of the [Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta][wheel] the adjective used in the enumeration of the eight branches of the path the word _right_ is used [Stephen Batchelor](https://www.stephenbatchelor.org/index.php/en/ "Website of Stephen and Martine Batchelor") suggests that this word is suboptimal, as it implies that there is also _wrong_ views... etcetera, I agree that a less absolute and helpful translation would be _appropriate_ this leads to the following definition:

1. appropriate view,
2. appropriate intention, 
3. appropriate speech, 
4. appropriate action, 
5. appropriate livelihood, 
6. appropriate effort, 
7. appropriate mindfulness (recollection), 
8. appropriate concentration.
