## The Middle Way

Although the idea of the midle path is used by many these days in a very broad sense, Gotama used it to mean a very specific middle way between two dead ends. Namely the dead end of sensual pleasure and the dead end of self-mortification. This definition of the middle way can be found in the first discourse given by Gotama, Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta [Rolling Forth the Wheel of Dhamma][wheel]. Translating self-mortification to lay persons psychology one might interpret it as self hatred or self denial. In the third paragraph of the above mentioned Sutra, Gotama defines the middle way as: 
> It is simply this noble eightfold path, ...

Which will be discussed below. Suffice to say that in this book the term middle way will be taken to mean being kind to oneself.

## Dependent origination

[The wikipedia page on dependent origination][dependent] states:

> Pratītyasamutpāda (Sanskrit: प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद pratītyasamutpāda; Pali: पटिच्चसमुप्पाद paṭiccasamuppāda), commonly translated as dependent origination, or dependent arising, is a key principle in Buddhist teachings, which states that all dharmas ("phenomena") arise in dependence upon other dharmas: "if this exists, that exists; if this ceases to exist, that also ceases to exist".

This concept could also be translated to inter-dependence or inter-being, the idea that nothing exists in itself but everything arises caused by something else. 

## The four noble truths

## The noble eightfold path

In both on [suttacentral](https://suttacentral.net/) available english translations of the [Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta][wheel] the adjective used in the enumeration of the eight branches of the path the word _right_ is used [Stephen Batchelor](https://www.stephenbatchelor.org/index.php/en/ "Website of Stephen and Martine Batchelor") suggests that this word as it implies that there is also _wrong_ views... etcetera, I agree that a less absolute and helpful translation would be _appropriate_ this leads to the following definition:

1. appropriate view,
2. appropriate intention, 
3. appropriate speech, 
4. appropriate action, 
5. appropriate livelihood, 
6. appropriate effort, 
7. appropriate mindfulness (recollection), 
8. appropriate concentration.
