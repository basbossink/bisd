# Historical context of the Buddha

According to [Wikipedia][gotama] 'Siddhāttha Gotama (शिद्धत्थ गोतम) in Pali' lived from around 563/480 – 483/400 BCE in the northeastern part of ancient India. The exact dates are still debated by historians. For our discussion it is important to note that upto this point the region were the Buddha lived was mostly an agricultural society. At the Buddha's lifetime cities started to emerge because the region had become that prosperous that a diversification of labour was possible and the forming of armies that were payed by a ruler could be sustained. Gotama was born as a member of the ruling class of a republic or oligarchy called Shakya. At this moment in time Hinduism was not yet present in the parts of ancient India where Gotama lived and tought.
